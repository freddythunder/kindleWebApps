# kindleWebApps
Rudimentary web based applications for Kindle's experimental web browser.

I recently bought a Kindle Scribe to better my personal and professional 
workflows.  Through the years I have written notes with pen and paper 
at my desk or creating sketches for 3d printing, but have always 
wanted to get away from actual paper.
